I am a driven, self motivated Senior Software Developer. I am driven by my "Why". Which is to impact as many lives as I can in a positive way. 
I first want to impact the lives of my peers, by leading by example and holding myself and others to a standard that gives them fulfillment in their job and life. 
Then I want to impact my community by producing software that assists in giving fulfillment in their job and life. 
My "Why" gives me clarity to see that leadership is a decision and not a title.
